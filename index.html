					<h3 class="description">Description</h3>
					<p>
						Dicechanics is a statistical library for modelling dice mechanics.
						It calculates the exact probability pr. instruction, and thus doesn't
						use any random generation.
						Through its interface one can define custom operations on a set of
						multiple dice, such that
						various dice mechanics one can think up can be modelled.
					</p>
					<p>
						The target audience is boardgames enthusiasts and -designers.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							To provide and easy to use interface, such that one can quickly
							test dice configurations and mechanics
						</li>
						<li>
							Calculating complex dice operations should not take longer
							to
							complete
							than getting a cup of coffee.
						</li>
					</ul>

				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Finding an algorithm that allows one to choose a subset of
								dice, from which operations are applied. Here is an
								example
								to
								illustrate the problem.
								You roll five d6 and get [1,1,3,5,6], you then want to
								sum the 3 largest numbers, which here results in
								3+5+6 = 14.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>
						The library is at the moment feature complete. The interface is for the
						most part intuitive and easy to use. However the custom operations needs
						a bit more work.
						For while the algorithm can take an arbitrary input, there is currently
						no
						way to set an initial/default state, which means that the function
						passed down
						needs to be written awkwardly.
					</p>
					<p>
						The performance on the selective algorithm (the one described in
						Challenges), is slower than i want it to be.
						The reason, however, is known. Its due to the current caching
						not being able to recognize that one problem is a subset of another.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am satisfied with where the library is at, however i am far from done
						with it and have quite a few ideas for improvement on all fronts.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Future ideas</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								I want to reimplement the library in C, and then extend
								python with it. Weather or Not the binding will
								be written
								through the Python API or by the library <a class=""
									href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11"
									target="_blank">Pybind</a> is not decided yet.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The library allows the user to use dice as a decorator
								over a mapping function.
								Here it would be nice if in the mapping function the
								user could refer to attributes of the die
								eg. the largest face.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This program was written for my thesis, which i worked on for a year
						doing covid shutdown. Its a post-processing dust particle simulation,
						for adding a layer of dust to
						already executed gas simulations. In this project the background model
						was a prestellar
						core, which is a part of the creation of stars and planets.
						<br><br>
						The program was made to run on lagrangian meshes, however the data is
						not available to me anymore. It can however run on a Bonnor-Ebert
						sphere, which the code can generate.

				<h3 class="description">Description</h3>
				<p>
					This was a small project made over a weekend. It generates a random maze, solves
					it and
					then displays it to the console.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project illustrates how i organize my C projects. I use abstract data types
					represented
					by opaque pointers. Two examples of such are the <a
						href="https://github.com/daplhall/Maze-Generation/blob/main/src/stack.c"
						target="_blank">Stack</a> (pointer stack) and the <a
						href="https://github.com/daplhall/Maze-Generation/blob/main/src/valstack.c"
						target="_blank">Valstack</a> (value stack).
					They have a defined interface from which one interacts with it, thus hiding the
					data from
					the user. This naturally leads to more safe code.
