					<h3 class="description">Description</h3>
					<p>
						Dicechanics is a statistical library for modelling dice mechanics.
						It calculates the exact probability pr. instruction, and thus doesn't
						use any random generation.
						Through its interface one can define custom operations on a set of
						multiple dice, such that
						various dice mechanics one can think up can be modelled.
					</p>
					<p>
						The target audience is boardgames enthusiasts and -designers.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							To provide and easy to use interface, such that one can quickly
							test dice configurations and mechanics
						</li>
						<li>
							Calculating complex dice operations should not take longer
							to
							complete
							than getting a cup of coffee.
						</li>
					</ul>

				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Finding an algorithm that allows one to choose a subset of
								dice which to do operations on.</p>
							<p>To illustrate what is meant here we can look at an example.
								You roll five d6 and get [1,1,3,5,6], you then want to
								sum the 3 largest numbers, which here results in
								3+5+6 = 14.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							Implementing a clean interface full of features, while still
							having good performance.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>
						The library is atm feature complete and can do the various standard
						operations which it should do. The interface is also quite intuitive
						although it does have some quirks suck as <code>Die.count</code> having
						to clean way
						of defining a range of numbers to count.
					</p>
					<p>
						The performance on the selective algorithm (the one described in
						Challenges), is slower than i want it to be
						however the reason for this is known, and its due to the current caching
						not being able to recognize already solved sub problems.
					</p>

					<p>
						I am satisfied with where the library is at, however i am far from done
						with it and have quite a few ideas for improvement on all fronts.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Future ideas</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								I want to reimplement the library in C, and then extend
								python with
								that
								implementation instead. Weather or Not the binding will
								be written
								through the Python API or by the library <a class=""
									href="https://github.com/pybind/pybind11"
									target="_blank">Pybind</a> is not decided yet.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Through the library you can use a die as a decorator to
								apply a
								function as a map, thus creating new die. However the
								only
								used argument
								for the decorated function is outcome.
								Here i want attributes such as the maximum face of the
								die to be
								available. Here one can use the python function
								<code>signature</code> to get the argument names. From
								which we can "type check" the argument names to ensure
								only allowed names are given, and if not raise an
								exception.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This program was written for my thesis, which i worked on for a year
						doing covid shutdown. Its a post-processing dust particle simulation,
						for adding a layer of dust to
						already executed gas simulations. In this project it was a prestellar
						core, which is a part of the creation process of stars and planets.
						<br><br>
						The program was made to run on lagrangian meshes, however the data is
						not available to me anymore. It can however run on a Bonnor-Ebert
						sphere, which the code can generate.

				<p>
					This was a small project made over a weekend. It generates a random maze, solves
					it and
					then displays it to the console.
				</p>
				<p>
					This project illustrates how i organize my C projects. I use abstract data types
					represented
					by opaque pointers. Two examples of such are the <a
						href="https://github.com/daplhall/Maze-Generation/blob/main/src/stack.c"
						target="_blank">Stack</a> (pointer stack) and the <a
						href="https://github.com/daplhall/Maze-Generation/blob/main/src/valstack.c"
						target="_blank">Valstack</a> (value stack).
					They have an defined interface for which to interact with it, thus hides the
					data from
					the user. This naturally leads to more safe code.
